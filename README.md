# Collaborative Shopping List

## Description

A collaborative shopping list web application that enables users to create personal accounts and join groups for shared list management.

The frontend provides real-time features including user authentication, group administration, and synchronized list editing.

Backend controllers handle data persistence for users, groups, memberships, and shopping lists, ensuring seamless collaboration across the platform.

## Motivation

This project aims to enhance proficiency in modern frontend development, specifically focusing on Vue3 (composition API), Pinia state management and Primevue component library. Through building a collaborative shopping list application, the goal is to gain practical experience with these frameworks while exploring their integration with .NET backend systems. The project will serve as a comprehensive learning platform for modern web development practices.

## Future Development

### Planned Features

**CSS Cascade Layers Implementation**
- Implementing CSS cascade layers to improve stylesheet organization and maintainability
- Following the methodology outlined in the [CSS-Tricks guide on CSS Cascade Layers](https://css-tricks.com/css-cascade-layers/)
- Requires Sass 1.77.4 or higher for SCSS cascade layers support
- This will enhance the project's styling architecture and provide better control over CSS specificity

**Offline Capabilities**
- Adding offline functionality using IndexedDB for local data persistence
- Implementing data synchronization between local storage and backend when connectivity is restored
- Following the [MDN IndexedDB API documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API) for implementation guidelines
- This will enable users to continue working with their shopping lists even without internet connectivity

These enhancements will further expand the learning scope to include advanced CSS architecture patterns and Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities.
