# Collaborative Shopping List Client

## Description

A collaborative shopping list web application that enables users to create personal accounts and join groups for shared list management.

The frontend provides real-time features including user authentication, group administration, and synchronized list editing.

Backend controllers handle data persistence for users, groups, memberships, and shopping lists, ensuring seamless collaboration across the platform.

## Motivation

This project aims to enhance proficiency in modern frontend development, specifically focusing on Vue3 (composition API), Pinia state management and Primevue component library. Through building a collaborative shopping list application, the goal is to gain practical experience with these frameworks while exploring their integration with .NET backend systems. The project will serve as a comprehensive learning platform for modern web development practices.
